# noderush

Gonna be a node rush soon, I can feel it in my bones...

I should probably practice building a node network. It's been a while.

# Controls:

- Q, W, E, R: select building type (node, generator, miner, energy cannon)
- Mouse: place buildings
- Escape: cancel / quit

Note resources displayed in top left.

Simulate extra players by using keys 0-9, and placing an initial Nexus with N.
